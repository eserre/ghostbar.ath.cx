<a href="http://jwz.org/xscreensaver">XScreenSaver</a> is of the most widely used screensavers app in Linux systems and works as well as a huge collection of screensavers for another apps like kscreensavers.

In <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> is maintained by only 2 persons which has in this moment lack of time. Because of this we're looking for <strong>co-maintainers</strong> that should accomplish the following main tasks:

<ul>
<li>Debugging actual tickets and check which ones exists yet.</li>
<li>Fixing bugs, creating and applying patches.</li>
<li>Check any issue that new upstream-releases may give to packages depending on xscreensaver like <a href="http://packages.debian.org/kscreensaver">kscreensaver</a>.</li>
</ul>

The package is hosted over <a href="http://git.or.cz">git</a> repositories, the official repo is at <a href="http://git.debian.org/?p=collab-maint/xscreensaver.git">git.debian.org under collab-maint/xscreensaver.git</a> and there's a copy under <a href="http://github.com/ghostbar/deb-xscreensaver">my GitHub account in deb-xscreensaver</a> so if you're interested you should learn something about maintaining debian packages with git and <a href="http://honk.sigxcpu.org/projects/git-buildpackage/manual-html/gbp.html">this guide of git-buildpackage could be useful for that</a>.

There are some tasks that needs to be done before releasing 5.08 (which is basically done):
<ul>
<li>Finishing <code>debian/copyright</code> that was practically empty leaving away many hacks and their proper copyright statement.</li>
<li>Checking which bugs were closed by the last upstream-release.</li>
<li>Checking with the KDE team which issues may give the new release with kscreensaver (which happens very often).</li>
</ul>

There's a pending approval for a project under alioth for maintaining XScreenSaver as a group because is a package that requires a lot of time and a group is the ideal way to work with this.

If you're interested answer to bug <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/521783">#521783</a>, make a fork of the git repo and start working! We need all the help you can give!
